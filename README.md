# Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Amazon Kindle product reviews. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, multiple machine learning models, and vectorization techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative using classical ML approaches.

## Features

* End-to-end workflow in a Jupyter Notebook (`Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`)
* Multiple ML models:

  * Naive Bayes (Bag-of-Words)
  * Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)
  * Random Forest with Word2Vec embeddings
* Trained model files included (`.pkl`, `.kv`)
* Data file (`all_kindle_review.csv`) containing the review dataset
* Word2Vec model for vector generation
* Documentation for Word2Vec + RandomForest model (`RandomForest_model_word2vec_link.md`)

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **NLTK** for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization)
* **Scikit-learn** for ML models and vectorization
* **Gensim** for Word2Vec embeddings
* **Pandas / NumPy** for data manipulation

## Models Included

### 1. **Naive Bayes (BoW)**

Uses CountVectorizer to convert text into Bag-of-Words features.

### 2. **Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)**

Uses TF-IDF vectorizer for text representation.

### 3. **Random Forest + Word2Vec**

Word embeddings generated by Gensim's Word2Vec model and used as features for a Random Forest classifier.
Model details provided in `RandomForest_model_word2vec_link.md`.

## Dataset

The dataset `all_kindle_review.csv` contains Kindle reviews with corresponding sentiment labels. Text data goes through preprocessing using NLTK:

* Lowercasing
* Tokenization
* Stopword removal
* Lemmatization

## Future Improvements

* Add deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
* Add deployment (Flask / FastAPI)
* Improve preprocessing pipeline
